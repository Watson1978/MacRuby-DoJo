When using the MacRuby, you would need to install the following softwares in advance.

- Mac OS X 10.6.8 later
- Xcode 4.2 or Xcode 4.3
- MacRuby

## Install Xcode
Install Xcode from the Mac App Store. Launch Mac App Store, and then, search Xcode with search field on top of right corner.

If you use the Mac OS X 10.6.8, Xcode 4.2.x will be installed. And if you use the Mac OS X 10.7.x, Xcode 4.3.x will be installed.

<div class="note">
Before installing Xcode 4.3.x, if you had been install an older version as Xcode 4.2.x, recommend to be running the following command on the Terminal.

```
$ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/
```

1. Select [Xcode]->[Preferencesâ€¦] to display Preferences form Xcode menu.
2. Select Downloads tab as shown in the figure below, and install Command Line Tools.

MacRuby 0.10 has been released now. However, unfortunately, it does not support for Xcode 4.3. Therefore, install the nightly build which could be downloaded from [http://www.macruby.org/files/nightlies/](http://www.macruby.org/files/nightlies/). Nightly build which has latest changes has packaged every night.

# Install BridgeSupport Preview 3
**For Mac OS X 10.6.8 users only**, need to install BridgeSupport Preview 3. BridgeSupport is used to get information about the Framework provided by the Mac OS X. In Mac OS X 10.7 environment, it has been pre-installed. You could get the BridgeSupport Preview 3 from [http://www.macruby.org/files/](http://www.macruby.org/files/) as *BridgeSupport Preview 3.zip*.
