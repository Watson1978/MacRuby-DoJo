If you have previously installed an older version (as Xcode 4.2.x) and installed Xcode 4.3.x at this time,
recommend to be running the following command on the Terminal.

MacRuby 0.10 has been released now. However, unfortunately, it does not support for Xcode 4.3. Therefore, you should install the nightly build and could download it from [http://www.macruby.org/files/nightlies/](http://www.macruby.org/files/nightlies/). Nightly build which has latest changes has packaged every night.

# Install BridgeSupport Preview 3
**For Mac OS X 10.6.8 users only**, need to install BridgeSupport Preview 3. BridgeSupport is used to get information about the Framework provided by the Mac OS X. In Mac OS X 10.7 environment, it has been pre-installed. You could get the BridgeSupport Preview 3 from [http://www.macruby.org/files/](http://www.macruby.org/files/) as *BridgeSupport Preview 3.zip*.
